For this assignment I would like you to create a simple web page that acts as a pseudo Movie Search database. In the repository there will be a JavaScript file that contains an array of movie objects, with each containing a movie title, release year, and plot summary. I would like you to create the HTML and JavaScript necessary to do the following:

Allow the user to perform a case insensitive search on the movies by title. You do not need to make it account for typos or anything like that, just exact matches. (Check out string.includes())
Display the first match to the page. Include all 3 properties of the object
If no match is found then display a message indicating that there are no matching movies
Once you've completed the frontend, you'll need to get a simple web server setup with express. Move any frontend files as you'd like, install express, and get the static middleware up and running. You should be able to completely use your site without the VS Code live server extension.

The rest of our assignments will not work with GitHub Pages. You'll still be committing and pushing to GitHub but you won't be enabling the static hosting in settings. So, once you've pushed to GitHub that would count as your submission. I'd still like you to do the quiz on D2L to make things a little easier, both for me and you, to track due dates and if you submitted.
